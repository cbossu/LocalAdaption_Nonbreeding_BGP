# Abstract

Investigating local adaptation on the nonbreeding ground of 3 migratory species. This includes investigating node-specific migratory connectivity (NMC_XY) or the spread of the breeding population on the nonbreeding ground and the distinctiveness of the nonbreeding environmental niche.

# Code
1.RDA_of_pop_allele_freq.R : Code to replicate RDA analyses run for 3 species on breeding and nonbreeding ground using population allele frequencies estimated using a snakemake pipeline, loco-pipe.

2.Climate_distinctiveness_nonbreeding.R: Code to replicate the environmental distinctiveness analysis. Large rasters and shapefiles will need to be downloaded separately, however, url to their location are provide.

3a.MigConnectivity_AMRE.Rmd : Code and data to replicate the MigConnectivity calculation of NMC for American redstart.

3b.MigConnectivity_SWTH.Rmd : Code and data to replicate the MigConnectivity calculation of NMC for Swainson's thrush.

3c.MigConnectivity_WIFL.Rmd : Code and data to replicate the MigConnectivity calculation of NMC for Willow flycatcher.

# Data
The genotypic data including genotype probabilities for breeding and nonbreeding individuals and allele frequncies for breeding and nonbreeding populations can be found on dryad:
